# How to Use
You must checkout the 3 wishlist repositories, `wishlist-api.gi`,
`wishlist-ui.git`, and `wishlist-tools.git` into directories with
those names, placed side by side. You can then run the docker-compose file.

You can comment out the `build` sections and pull an image from the docker hub.
